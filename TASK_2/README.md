# Simple Calculator
A Calculator is basically a program on a computer that simulates the behavior of any hand-held calculator useful for performing Mathematical Calculations. It is a very basic device used in our everyday lives. Now all the smartphones also have a Calculator application in them.

While creating any GUI Application there are mainly two steps:
- The first step is to create a User Interface.
- The second step is the most important one and in this, to add functionalities to the GUI
<br />
To initialize the to-do list window, you need to initialize the Tk() class to a variable. Then, you need to set the following attributes:
<br />
=> ' title() ' method is used to give a title to the project window.
<br />
=> ' geometry() ' method is used to set the initial geometry of window.
<br />
=> ' resizable() ' method is used to allow/deny the user the permission to resize the python to-do list window. It takes truthy and falsy values and arguments to the parameters width and height.
<br />
=> ' config() ' method is used to configure some extra attributes of the window, like bg or background to set the background color.
<br />
=> ' update() ' and .mainloop() methods are used to put the window in a loop to prevent it from closing nanoseconds after it opens.
<br />
<br />
There are a variety of functions in Tkinter with the help of them it becomes easy and convenient to make a simple calculator just with this little code.
Apart from the Tkinter widgets, we have defined the following functions in our code:
<br />
- btn_click() Function: This function handles the button click on various numeric buttons to add them to the operation.
<br />
- bt_clear() Function: This function is used to handle the clear operation to clean the previous input in the Calculator application.
<br />
- bt_equal() Function: This function is used to handle the equal button to execute the operation and show the result.
